# Simulation for muon monitor #

## Installation ##
1. Check if system features Java 8 runtime by `java -version` command. Oracle java is better, but OpenJDK will do.
2. Download [distribution tar](https://bitbucket.org/mipt-npm/muon-sim/downloads/muonsim-1.0-SNAPSHOT.tar).
3. Unpack it.
3. Run it from bin directory (bash script or batch file).

***For some unknown reason it does not work with OpenJDK***
